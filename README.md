# K Barrett Realty
Mongo and Bootstrap

Welcome to weekend challenge 4! This weekend, you will take on the role of an application developer for a real estate company. You will be working with Data that we will be providing to you. It will be a collection called “listings”. Inside of it, you will find information for properties that are either for Rent or for Sale.

You job, is to get this Data on the DOM, accounting for the inconsistent datatypes that are possible with MongoDB. But additionally, let’s bring in Bootstrap to the mix to make sure that the application looks as good as possible.

Here are the requirements of the project:

Create a Full Stack application from the ground up using jQuery, Node, and MongoDB,

Work with the data set that we provide for you,

Use Bootstrap to present the data,

Account for the different data (“rent” versus “cost) and ensure that this is noted on the display of the information, by listing “For Rent” or “For Sale” based on which of the two properties that it has.
